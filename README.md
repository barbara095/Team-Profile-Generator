# Team-Profile-Generator
A great application that generates a profile of your team!

## Description
This is a Node CLI application that takes in information about employees including their role, name, id and email address, as well as other attributes that are role-specific. An HTML page is generated with the rendered profiles and their respective attributes.

There are three roles - Manager, Engineer and Intern, which all inherit the properties of its parent class - 'Employee.' 

Each class passes the unit tests.
